# Repository Guidelines

This short guide explains how to work in this React 18 codebase.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/`: App source. Main logic in `src/App.js`; styles in `src/App.css`; entry in `src/index.js` and `src/index.css`. Tests live next to files or under `src/__tests__/`.
- `public/`: Static assets served at runtime. Wordlists must live here (e.g., `public/wordlist.txt`, `public/common.txt`) and be fetched with `fetch(process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/wordlist.txt')`.
- `build/`: Production bundle generated by the build step. Do not edit.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm install` — Install dependencies.
- `npm start` — Launch dev server at `http://localhost:3000` with fast refresh and lint hints.
- `npm run build` — Create optimized production build in `build/`.
- `npm test` — Run Jest in watch mode (press `a` to run all).
- `npm run deploy` — Build then `rsync` to `robteix.com:/data/www/wsolver/` (maintainers only; SSH required).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: modern ES modules; React function components with Hooks.
- Style: 2-space indent, semicolons, single quotes.
- Files: Components use PascalCase (e.g., `WordListPanel.js`); colocate styles in CSS modules or `App.css`.
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Linting: ESLint via `react-scripts`; fix warnings before commit.

## Testing Guidelines

- Tools: Jest + React Testing Library.
- Location: `*.test.js` next to source or in `src/__tests__/` (e.g., `src/App.test.js`).
- Focus: cover filtering rules and duplicate-letter logic in `App.js`.
- Coverage: `npm test -- --coverage` for a report.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commits: short, imperative subject lines (~50–72 chars), e.g., "add virtual keyboard on mobile"; include a body when helpful.
- PRs: describe intent, list key changes, include screenshots/GIFs for UI tweaks, link related issues. Ensure `npm test` passes and avoid unrelated refactors.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Never commit secrets; CRA exposes only env vars prefixed with `REACT_APP_`.
- Keep network-fetched wordlists in `public/` and reference them via `process.env.PUBLIC_URL`.

## Agent-Specific Instructions

- Scope: This file applies repo-wide; a deeper `AGENTS.md` overrides for its subtree.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; follow existing patterns and naming.
- Do not modify `build/`; update docs when behavior changes. Prefer proposing over destructive actions.
